# CSEN342

Program 1: Peptide Classification
•	Created a feed-forward neural network to extract features from an imbalanced dataset of peptides and determine if they are able to pass by biofilm or not.

Program 2: Finetuning Yolo
•	Fine-tuned a YOLO object detection model in PyTorch to identify different car types, improving detection accuracy with optimized training parameters

Program 3: Audio Classification
•	Developed a CNN-based audio classifier with Mel spectrogram input features on a multi-class audio dataset
